Our university department has compiled some slides, and I am giving you their slide of Lab 01 [right here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nb0JL2L8qrE4US3FOJGIlTHwVpFEwDIZ7HYwHgYUA2U/edit?usp=sharing)!

You can read the university slide, and if you can't understand anything, then let me know in the next class. 

Also, please make sure to remember me to cover any newer things that you have found in the university slide.

You will not get any question from Quantum Computers/Computing. Therefore, simply watch the video just to know why it is a hyped thing nowadays and how it actually works. It seems nice to keep yourselves updated with the newer technologies everyday, right?
