# Instructions

Updated information: You can directly knock me via WhatsApp if you feel the urgent need. You already have my phone numbers. However, if it is something that you need to show me, then the better approach would be to utilize emails.

Make sure to write the mail subject in this way: `(SPL-H) .......subject.....`

Please try to write relevant subject as it helps me to identify the issue quickly before opening the email.

## Counselling 

I will update the counselling hour later. In the meantime, if you need me, then you can utilize the mail. Let me know beforehand if you want my counseling hour in my room (935). I will make sure to give you a free time slot then. If you can't find me in my room even after that, then you can let me know via WhatsApp or in emergency, directly call me!

<!-- ## Group Chat

A group chat has been created and till now, we have 2 CRs (Class Representative) named **Abdullah Bin Lokman**, and **Jobayar Islam**.

> If you can't see the earlier important messages for joining later, you can ask anyone there to repeat the earlier messages for you. Also, the website will stay updated. I will also add all the content in the LMS once it is available online.

The joining link is **not given here anymore** for privacy reason. -->

If you need any help, then you can directly reach out to me. I always try to be helpful towards you as a faculty, you all are my responsibility.


Lastly, dear my **GenZ** students. Wishing you the best of luck. Congratulations on your amazing journey and career opportunity ahead.
